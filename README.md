# Flight-Delay-Analysis---2015

### I'm excited to share my latest project: an in-depth analysis of 2015 flight delay data in the US, conducted in collaboration with ITI. By analyzing over 6 million flight records, I've unearthed valuable insights that can benefit both airlines and travelers.
## Key Questions Explored:

#### 1-How do weekday and weekend flight statistics compare?
#### 2-What are the monthly cancellation trends for JetBlue Airways?
#### 3-How do delays vary by week, state, city, and airline?
#### 4-Which airlines experience no departure/arrival delays within the 2500-3000 distance range?
#### 5-What are the flight counts for each airline?
#### 6-What are the quarterly trends in flight cancellations?
#### 7-How are flight counts distributed among different delay types?
#### 8-How does flight volume vary by month and day of the week?
#### 9-What percentage of flights experienced departure delays in 2015, and what was the average delay time?
#### 10-How does the percentage of delayed flights change throughout the year, particularly for flights departing from Boston (BOS)?
#### 11-How many flights were cancelled in 2015, and what percentage were due to weather vs. airline/carrier issues?
#### 12-Which airlines demonstrate the highest and lowest reliability in terms of on-time departures?
## Insights Revealed:

#### 1-In 2015, a total of 5,819,079 flights were recorded, with significant variation between weekend and weekday operations.
#### 2-JetBlue experienced its highest cancellations in June (55), with none in January.
#### 3-Southwest Airlines operated the most flights, while Virgin America had the fewest.
#### 4-Arrival and departure delays were prevalent, highlighting the need for improvement in minimizing these occurrences.
